My humble dwelling amongst the Cyberspace, created and deployed using
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

**Currently Under Construction**

## 🥋 Getting Started

Use your favourite package manager and run `yarn install` or `npm install` to
install all the dependencies, and I do mean all of them, there are a lot.
Afterwards, run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to launch a local development
server, and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). The
page will hot-reload when any change is detected in the source files.

Production steps are handled [automagically by Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/next.js/overview#supported-next.js-features),
but running `yarn build` or `npm run build` locally will still produce an
unoptimised, less-than-ideal static version.

corrections.
